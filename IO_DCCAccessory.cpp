// Note: For DCC Accessory Decoders, a particular output can be specified by 
// a linear address, or by an address/subaddress pair, where the subaddress is
// in the range 0 to 3 and specifies an output within a group of 4.
// NMRA and DCC++EX accepts addresses in the range 0-511.  Linear addresses
// are not specified by the NMRA and so different manufacturers may calculate them
// in different ways.  DCC+EX uses a range of 1-2044 which excludes decoder address 0.
// Therefore, I've avoided using linear addresses here because of the ambiguities 
// involved.  Instead I've used the term 'packedAddress'.
