// Uncomment the following #define statement to use callback notification
//  where the driver supports it.
//  The principle of callback notification is to avoid the Sensor class
//  having to poll the device driver cyclically for input values, and then scan 
//  for changes.  Instead, when the driver scans the inputs, if it detects
//  a change it invokes a callback function in the Sensor class.  In the current
//  implementation, the advantages are limited because (a) the Sensor class 
//  performs debounce checks, and (b) the Sensor class does not have a 
//  static reference to the output stream for sending <Q>/<q> messages
//  when a change is detected.  These restrictions mean that the checkAll() 
//  method still has to iterate through all of the Sensor objects looking 
//  for changes.
#define USE_NOTIFY

struct SensorData {
  int snum;
  VPIN pin;
  uint8_t pullUp;
};

class Sensor{
  // The sensor list is a linked list where each sensor's 'nextSensor' field points to the next.
  //   The pointer is null in the last on the list.
  //   To partition the sensor into those sensors which require polling through cyclic calls
  //   to 'IODevice::read(vpin)', and those which support callback on change, 'firstSensor' 
  //   points to the start of the overall list, and 'lastSensor' points to the end of the list
  //   (the last sensor object). This structure allows sensors to be added to the start or the
  //   end of the list easily.  So if an input pin supports change notification, it is placed at the 
  //   end of the list.  If not, it is placed at the beginning.  And the pointer 'firstPollSensor' 
  //   is set to the first of the sensor objects that requires scanning.  Thus, we can iterate
  //   through the whole list, or just through the part that requires scanning.
