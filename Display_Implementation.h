// This implementation is designed to be #included ONLY ONCE in the .ino 
//
// It will create a driver implemntation and a shim class implementation.
// This means that other classes can reference the shim without knowing

// Implement the Display shim class as a singleton.
// The DisplayInterface class implements a display handler with no code (null device);
// The Display class sub-classes DisplayInterface to provide the common display code;
// Then Display class talks to the specific device type classes:
//    SSD1306AsciiWire for I2C OLED driver with SSD1306 or SH1106 controllers;
//    LiquidCrystal_I2C for I2C LCD driver for HD44780 with PCF8574 'backpack'.
