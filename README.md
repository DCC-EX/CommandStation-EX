# Whatâ€™s in this Repository?

This repository, CommandStation-EX, contains a complete DCC-EX *EX-CommmandStation* sketch designed for compiling and uploading into an Arduino Uno, Mega, or Nano.

To utilize this sketch, you can use the following: 

1. (recommended for all levels of user) our [automated installer](https://github.com/DCC-EX/EX-Installer)
2. (intermediate) download the latest version from the [releases page](https://github.com/DCC-EX/CommandStation-EX/releases)
3. (advanced) use git clone on this repository 

Refer to [our web site](https://https://dcc-ex.com/ex-commandstation/get-started/index.html#/) for the hardware required for this project.

**We seriously recommend using the EX-Installer**, however if you choose not to use the installer... 

* Open the file ``CommandStation-EX.ino`` in the Arduino IDE or Visual Studio Code (VSC). Please do not rename the folder containing the sketch code, nor add any files in that folder. The Arduino IDE relies on the structure and name of the folder to properly display and compile the code. 
* Rename or copy ``config.example.h`` to ``config.h``. 
* You must edit ``config.h`` according to the help texts in ``config.h``.
