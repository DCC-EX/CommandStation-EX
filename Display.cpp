/* The strategy for drawing the screen is as follows.
 *  1) There are up to eight rows of text to be displayed.
 *  2) Blank rows of text are ignored.
 *  3) If there are more non-blank rows than screen lines,
 *     then all of the rows are displayed, with the rest of the
 *     screen being blank.
 *  4) If there are fewer non-blank rows than screen lines,
 *     then a scrolling strategy is adopted so that, on each screen
 *     refresh, a different subset of the rows is presented.
 *  5) On each entry into loop2(), a single operation is sent to the
 *     screen; this may be a position command or a character for
 *     display.  This spreads the onerous work of updating the screen
 *     and ensures that other loop() functions in the application are
 *     not held up significantly.  The exception to this is when
 *     the loop2() function is called with force=true, where
 *     a screen update is executed to completion.  This is normally
 *     only done during start-up.
 *  The scroll mode is selected by defining SCROLLMODE as 0, 1 or 2
 *  in the config.h.
 *  #define SCROLLMODE 0 is scroll continuous (fill screen if poss),
 *  #define SCROLLMODE 1 is by page (alternate between pages),
 *  #define SCROLLMODE 2 is by row (move up 1 row at a time).
