/* 
 * The HC-SR04 module has an ultrasonic transmitter (40kHz) and a receiver.
 * It is operated through two signal pins.  When the transmit pin is set to 1 for 
 * 10us, on the falling edge the transmitter sends a short transmission of 
 * 8 pulses (like a sonar 'ping').  This is reflected off objects and received
 * by the receiver.  A pulse is sent on the receive pin whose length is equal
 * to the delay between the transmission of the pulse and the detection of
 * its echo.  The distance of the reflecting object is calculated by halving
 * the time (to allow for the out and back distance), then multiplying by the
 * speed of sound (assumed to be constant).
 * 
 * This driver polls the HC-SR04 by sending the trigger pulse and then measuring
 * the length of the received pulse.  If the calculated distance is less than the
 * threshold, the output changes to 1.  If it is greater than the threshold plus
 * a hysteresis margin, the output changes to 0.
 * 
 * The measurement would be more reliable if interrupts were disabled while the
 * pulse is being timed.  However, this would affect other functions in the CS
 * so the measurement is being performed with interrupts enabled.  Also, we could
 * use an interrupt pin in the Arduino for the timing, but the same consideration 
 * applies.
 * 
 * Note: The timing accuracy required by this means that the pins have to be 
 * direct Arduino pins; GPIO pins on an IO Extender cannot provide the required
 * accuracy.
