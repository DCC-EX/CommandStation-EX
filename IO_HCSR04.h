/*
 * The HC-SR04 module has an ultrasonic transmitter (40kHz) and a receiver.
 * It is operated through two signal pins.  When the transmit pin is set to 1
 * for 10us, on the falling edge the transmitter sends a short transmission of
 * 8 pulses (like a sonar 'ping').  This is reflected off objects and received
 * by the receiver.  A pulse is sent on the receive pin whose length is equal
 * to the delay between the transmission of the pulse and the detection of
 * its echo.  The distance of the reflecting object is calculated by halving
 * the time (to allow for the out and back distance), then multiplying by the
 * speed of sound (assumed to be constant).
 *
 * This driver polls the HC-SR04 by sending the trigger pulse and then measuring
 * the length of the received pulse.  If the calculated distance is less than
 * the threshold, the output _state returned by a read() call changes to 1.  If
 * the distance is greater than the threshold plus a hysteresis margin, the
 * output changes to 0. The device also supports readAnalogue(), which returns
 * the measured distance in cm, or 32767 if the distance exceeds the
 * offThreshold.
 *
 * It might be thought that the measurement would be more reliable if interrupts
 * were disabled while the pulse is being timed.  However, this would affect
 * other functions in the CS so the measurement is being performed with
 * interrupts enabled.  Also, we could use an interrupt pin in the Arduino for
 * the timing, but the same consideration applies.  In any case, the DCC
 * interrupt occurs once every 58us, so any IRC code is much faster than that.
 * And 58us corresponds to 1cm in the calculation, so the effect of
 * interrupts is negligible.
 *
 * Note: The timing accuracy required for measuring the pulse length means that
 * the pins have to be direct Arduino pins; GPIO pins on an IO Extender cannot
 * provide the required accuracy.
 *
 * Example configuration:
 *  HCSR04::create(23000, 32, 33, 80, 85);
 *
 * Where 23000 is the VPIN allocated,
 *       32 is the pin connected to the HCSR04 trigger terminal,
 *       33 is the pin connected to the HCSR04 echo terminal,
 *       80 is the distance in cm below which pin 23000 will be active,
 *   and 85 is the distance in cm above which pin 23000 will be inactive.
 *
 * Alternative configuration, which hogs the processor until the measurement is complete
 * (old behaviour, more accurate but higher impact on other CS tasks):
 *  HCSR04::create(23000, 32, 33, 80, 85, HCSR04::LOOP);
