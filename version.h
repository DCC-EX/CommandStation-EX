//         EX-RAIL “ROSTER” Engines Id & Function key layout on Engine Driver or WiThrottle
//         EX-RAIL DCC++EX Commands to Control EX-RAIL via JMRI Send pane and IDE Serial monitors
//       New JMRI feature enhancements; 
//         Reads DCC++EX EEPROM & automatically uploades any Signals, DCC Turnouts, Servo Turnouts, Vpin Turnouts , & Output pane
//         Turnout class revised to expand turnout capabilities, new commands added.
//         Provides for multiple additional DCC++EX WiFi connections as accessory controllers or CS for a programming track when Motor Shields are added
//         Supports Multiple Command Station connections and individual tracking of Send DCC++ Command panes and DCC++ Traffic Monitor panes
//       New HAL added for I/O (digital and analogue inputs and outputs, servos etc)
//         Automatically detects & connects to supported devices included in your config.h file
//         Support for MCP23008, MCP23017 and PCF9584 I2C GPIO Extender modules.
//         Support for PCA9685 PWM (servo) control modules.

//         Support for VL53L0X Laser range sensor module (Time-Of-Flight).
//         Added <D HAL SHOW> diagnostic command to show configured devices
//       New Processor Support added
//         Compiles on Nano Every and Teensy
//       Native non-blocking I2C drivers for AVR and Nano architectures (fallback to blocking Wire library for other platforms).
//       Can disable EEPROM code
//       EEPROM layout change - deletes EEPROM contents on first start following upgrade.
//       Output class now allows ID > 255.
//       Configuration options to globally flip polarity of DCC Accessory states when driven from <a> command and <T> command.
//       Increased use of display for showing loco decoder programming information.
//       Can define border between long and short addresses
//       Turnout and accessory states (thrown/closed = 0/1 or 1/0) can be set to match RCN-213
//       Bugfix: one-off error in CIPSEND drop
