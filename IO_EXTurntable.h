/*
* The IO_EXTurntable device driver is used to control a turntable via an Arduino with a stepper motor over I2C.
*
* The EX-Turntable code lives in a separate repo (https://github.com/DCC-EX/Turntable-EX) and contains the stepper motor logic.
*
* This device driver sends a step position to Turntable-EX to indicate the step position to move to using either of these commands:
* <D TT vpin steps activity> in the serial console
* MOVETT(vpin, steps, activity) in EX-RAIL
* Refer to the documentation for further information including the valid activities.
