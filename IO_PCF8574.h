/* 
 * The PCF8574 is a simple device; it only has one register.  The device 
 * input/output mode and pullup are configured through this, and the 
 * output state is written and the input state read through it too.
 * 
 * This is accomplished by having a weak resistor in series with the output,
 * and a read-back of the other end of the resistor.  As an output, the 
 * pin state is set to 1 or 0, and the output voltage goes to +5V or 0V
 * (through the weak resistor).
 * 
 * In order to use the pin as an input, the output is written as
 * a '1' in order to pull up the resistor.  Therefore the input will be
 * 1 unless the pin is pulled down externally, in which case it will be 0.
 * 
 * As a consequence of this approach, it is not possible to use the device for
 * inputs without pullups.
