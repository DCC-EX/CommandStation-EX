/*
* The IO_DS1307 device driver is used to interface a standalone realtime clock. 
* The clock will announce every minute (which will trigger EXRAIL ONTIME events).
* Seconds, and Day/date info is ignored, except that the announced hhmm time
* will attempt to synchronize with the 0 seconds of the clock. 
* An analog read in EXRAIL (IFGTE(vpin, value) etc will check against the hh*60+mm time.
* The clock can be easily set by an analog write to the vpin using 24 hr clock time
* with the command <z vpin hh mm ss>
