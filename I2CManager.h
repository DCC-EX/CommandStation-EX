/* 
 * Manager for I2C communications.  For portability, it allows use 
 * of the Wire class, but also has a native implementation for AVR
 * which supports non-blocking queued I/O requests.
 * 
 * Helps to avoid calling Wire.begin() multiple times (which is not)
 * entirely benign as it reinitialises).
 * 
 * Also helps to avoid the Wire clock from being set, by another device
 * driver, to a speed which is higher than a device supports.
 * 
 * Thirdly, it provides a convenient way to check whether there is a 
 * device on a particular I2C address.
 * 
 * Non-blocking requests are issued by creating an I2C Request Block
 * (I2CRB) which is then added to the I2C manager's queue.  The 
 * application refers to this block to check for completion of the
 * operation, and for reading completion status.
 * 
 * Examples:
 *  I2CRB rb;
 *  uint8_t status = I2CManager.write(address, buffer, sizeof(buffer), &rb);
 *  ...
 *  if (!rb.isBusy()) {
 *    status = rb.status;
 *    // Repeat write
 *    I2CManager.queueRequest(&rb);
 *    ...
 *    status = rb.wait(); // Wait for completion and read status
 *  }
 *  ...
 *  I2CRB rb2;
 *  outbuffer[0] = 12;  // Register number in I2C device to be read
 *  rb2.setRequestParams(address, inBuffer, 1, outBuffer, 1);
 *  status = I2CManager.queueRequest(&rb2);
 *  if (status == I2C_STATUS_OK) { 
 *    status = rb2.wait();
 *    if (status == I2C_STATUS_OK) {
 *      registerValue = inBuffer[0];
 *    }
 *  }
 *  ...
 *  
 * Synchronous (blocking) calls are also possible, e.g. 
 *  status = I2CManager.write(address, buffer, sizeof(buffer));
 * 
 * When using non-blocking requests, neither the I2CRB nor the input or output
 * buffers should be modified until the I2CRB is complete (not busy).
 * 
 * Timeout monitoring is possible, but requires that the following call is made
 * reasonably frequently in the program's loop() function:
 *  I2CManager.loop();
 *

/* 
 * Future enhancement possibility:
 *
 *  I2C Multiplexer (e.g. TCA9547, TCA9548)
 * 
 *  A multiplexer offers a way of extending the address range of I2C devices.  For example, GPIO extenders use address range 0x20-0x27
 *  to are limited to 8 on a bus.  By adding a multiplexer, the limit becomes 8 for each of the multiplexer's 8 sub-buses, i.e. 64.
 *  And a single I2C bus can have up to 8 multiplexers, giving up to 64 sub-buses and, in theory, up to 512 I/O extenders; that's 
 *  as many as 8192 input/output pins!
 *  Secondly, the capacitance of the bus is an electrical limiting factor of the length of the bus, speed and number of devices.
 *  The multiplexer isolates each sub-bus from the others, and so reduces the capacitance of the bus.  For example, with one 
 *  multiplexer and 64 GPIO extenders, only 9 devices are connected to the bus at any time (multiplexer plus 8 extenders). 
 *  Thirdly, the multiplexer offers the ability to use mixed-speed devices more effectively, by allowing high-speed devices to be
 *  put on a different bus to low-speed devices, enabling the software to switch the I2C speed on-the-fly between I2C transactions.
 * 
 *  Changes required:  Increase the size of the I2CAddress field in the IODevice class from uint8_t to uint16_t.
 *  The most significant byte would contain a '1' bit flag, the multiplexer number (0-7) and bus number (0-7).  Then, when performing
 *  an I2C operation, the I2CManager would check this byte and, if zero, do what it currently does.  If the byte is non-zero, then
 *  that means the device is connected via a multiplexer so the I2C transaction should be preceded by a select command issued to the
 *  relevant multiplexer.
 * 
 *  Non-interrupting I2C:
 * 
 *  I2C may be operated without interrupts (undefine I2C_USE_INTERRUPTS).  Instead, the I2C state
 *  machine handler, currently invoked from the interrupt service routine, is invoked from the loop() function.
 *  The speed at which I2C operations can be performed then becomes highly dependent on the frequency that 
 *  the loop() function is called, and may be adequate under some circumstances.  
 *  The advantage of NOT using interrupts is that the impact of I2C upon the DCC waveform (when accurate timing mode isn't in use)
 *  becomes almost zero.
 *  This mechanism is under evaluation and should not be relied upon as yet.
