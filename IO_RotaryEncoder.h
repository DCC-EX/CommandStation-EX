/*
* The IO_RotaryEncoder device driver is used to receive positions from a rotary encoder connected to an Arduino via I2C.
*
* There is separate code required for the Arduino the rotary encoder is connected to, which is located here:
* https://github.com/peteGSX-Projects/dcc-ex-rotary-encoder
*
* This device driver receives the rotary encoder position when the rotary encoder button is pushed, and these positions
* can be tested in EX-RAIL with:
* ONCHANGE(vpin) - flag when the rotary encoder position has changed from the previous position
* IFRE(vpin, position) - test to see if specified rotary encoder position has been received
*
* Further to this, feedback can be sent to the rotary encoder by using 2 Vpins, and sending a SET()/RESET() to the second Vpin.
* A SET(vpin) will flag that a turntable (or anything else) is in motion, and a RESET(vpin) that the motion has finished.
*
* Refer to the documentation for further information including the valid activities and examples.
