/*
* The IO_RotaryEncoder device driver is used to receive positions from a rotary encoder connected to an Arduino via I2C.
*
* There is separate code required for the Arduino the rotary encoder is connected to, which is located here:
* *TBA*
*
* This device driver receives the rotary encoder position when the rotary encoder button is pushed, and these positions
* can be tested in EX-RAIL with:
* ONCHANGE(vpin) - flag when the rotary encoder position has changed from the previous position
* IFRE(vpin, position) - test to see if specified rotary encoder position has been received
*
* Refer to the documentation for further information including the valid activities and examples.
