/* 
Bitmap provides a set of virtual pins with no hardware.
Bitmap pins are able to be output and input and may be set and tested 
as digital or analogue values.
When writing a digital value, the analogue value is set to 0 or 1. 
When reading a digital value, the return is LOW for value 0 or HIGH for any other value
or analogue.

Bitmap pins may be used for any purpose, this is easier to manage than LATCH in EXRAIL
as they can be explicitely set and tested without interfering with underlying hardware.
Bitmap pins may be set, reset and tested in the same way as any other pin.
They are not persistent across reboots, but are retained in the current session.
Bitmap pins may also be monitored by JMRI_SENSOR() and <S> as for any other pin.
