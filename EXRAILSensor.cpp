/**********************************************************************
EXRAILSensor represents a sensor that should be monitored in order
to call an exrail ONBUTTON or ONCHANGE handler.
These are created at EXRAIL startup and thus need no delete or listing
capability.
The basic logic is similar to that found in the Sensor class
except that on the relevant change an EXRAIL thread is started.
