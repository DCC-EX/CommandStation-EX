/* This is an automation example file.
 *  The presence of a file called "myAutomation.h" brings EX-RAIL code into
 *  the command station.
 *  The auotomation may have multiple concurrent tasks. 
 *  A task may drive one loco through a ROUTE or may simply 
 *  automate some other part of the layout without any loco.
 *  
 *  At startup, a single task is created to execute the first 
 *  instruction after ROUTES. 
 *  This task may simply follow a route, or may SCHEDULE  
 *  further tasks (thats is.. send a loco out along a route).
 *  
 *  Where the loco id is not known at compile time, a new task 
 *  can be creatd with the command:
 *  </ SCHEDULE [cab] route> 
 *
