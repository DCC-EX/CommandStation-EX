/* This timer class is used to manage the single timer required to handle the DCC waveform.
 *  All timer access comes through this class so that it can be compiled for 
 *  various hardware CPU types. 
 *  
 *  DCCEX works on a single timer interrupt at a regular 58uS interval.
 *  The DCCWaveform class generates the signals to the motor shield  
 *  based on this timer. 
 *  
 *  If the motor drivers are BOTH configured to use the correct 2 pins for the architecture,
 *  (see isPWMPin() function. )
 *  then this allows us to use a hardware driven pin switching arrangement which is
 *  achieved by setting the duty cycle of the NEXT clock interrupt to 0% or 100% depending on 
 *  the required pin state. (see setPWM())  
 *  This is more accurate than the software interrupt but at the expense of 
 *  limiting the choice of available pins. 
 *  Fortunately, a standard motor shield on a Mega uses pins that qualify for PWM... 
 *  Other shields may be jumpered to PWM pins or run directly using the software interrupt.
 *  
 *  Because the PWM-based waveform is effectively set half a cycle after the software version,
 *  it is not acceptable to drive the two tracks on different methiods or it would cause
 *  problems for <1 JOIN> etc.
 *
