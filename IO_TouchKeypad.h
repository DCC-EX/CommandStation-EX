/* 
 * Driver for capacitative touch-pad based on the TTP229-B chip with serial 
 * (not I2C) output.  The touchpad has 16 separate pads in a 4x4 matrix, 
 * numbered 1-16.  The communications with the pad are via a clock signal sent
 * from the controller to the device, and a data signal sent back by the device.
 * The pins clockPin and dataPin must be local pins, not external (GPIO Expander)
 * pins.
 * 
 * To use, 
 *    TouchKeypad::create(firstVpin, 16, clockPin, dataPin);
 * 
 * NOTE: Most of these keypads ship with only 8 pads enabled.  To enable all
 * sixteen pads, locate the area of the board labelled P1 (four pairs of 
 * holes labelled 1 to 4 from the left); solder a jumper link between the pair 
 * labelled 3 (connected to pin TP2 on the chip).  When this link is connected,
 * the pins OUT1 to OUT8 are not used but all sixteen touch pads are operational.
 * 
 * TODO: Allow a list of datapins to be provided so that multiple keypads can
 * be read simultaneously by the one device driver and the one shared clock signal.
 * As it stands, we can configure multiple driver instances, one for each keypad, 
 * and it will work fine.  The clock will be driven to all devices but only one 
 * driver will be reading the responses from its corresponding device at a time.
